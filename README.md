# [random-walker](https://haritonch.github.io/random-walker/)
A simple and good looking random walk simulation. The walker never steps back to where it was in the previous step, while choosing uniformly its next step from the other 3 directions.
It is based on a tutorial from [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw)
